    # Prompts for input, handling playback of prompts, DTMF grammar construction, and execution
    #
    # @example A basic DTMF digit collection:
    #   ask "Welcome, ", "/opt/sounds/menu-prompt.mp3",
    #       timeout: 10, terminator: '#', limit: 3
    #
    # The first arguments will be a list of sounds to play, as accepted by #play, including strings for TTS, Date and Time objects, and file paths.
    # :timeout, :terminator and :limit options may be specified to automatically construct a grammar, or grammars may be manually specified.
    #
    # @param [Object, Array<Object>] args A list of outputs to play, as accepted by #play
    # @param [Hash] options Options to modify the grammar
    # @option options [Boolean] :interruptible If the prompt should be interruptible or not. Defaults to true
    # @option options [Integer] :limit Digit limit (causes collection to cease after a specified number of digits have been collected)
    # @option options [Integer] :timeout Timeout in seconds before the first and between each input digit
    # @option options [String] :terminator Digit to terminate input
    # @option options [RubySpeech::GRXML::Grammar, Array<RubySpeech::GRXML::Grammar>] :grammar One of a collection of grammars to execute
    # @option options [String, Array<String>] :grammar_url One of a collection of URLs for grammars to execute
    # @option options [Hash] :input_options A hash of options passed directly to the Punchblock Input constructor. See
    # @option options [Hash] :output_options A hash of options passed directly to the Punchblock Output constructor
    #
    # @return [Result] a result object from which the details of the utterance may be established

    # Creates and manages a multiple choice menu driven by DTMF, handling playback of prompts,
    # invalid input, retries and timeouts, and final failures.
    #
    # @example A complete example of the method is as follows:
    #   menu "Welcome, ", "/opt/sounds/menu-prompt.mp3", tries: 2, timeout: 10 do
    #     match 1, OperatorController
    #
    #     match 10..19 do
    #       pass DirectController
    #     end
    #
    #     match 5, 6, 9 do |exten|
    #       play "The #{exten} extension is currently not active"
    #     end
    #
    #     match '7', OfficeController
    #
    #     invalid { play "Please choose a valid extension" }
    #     timeout { play "Input timed out, try again." }
    #     failure { pass OperatorController }
    #   end
    #
    # The first arguments will be a list of sounds to play, as accepted by #play, including strings for TTS, Date and Time objects, and file paths.
    # :tries and :timeout options respectively specify the number of tries before going into failure, and the timeout in seconds allowed on each digit input.
    # The most important part is the following block, which specifies how the menu will be constructed and handled.
    #
    # #match handles connecting an input pattern to a payload.
    # The pattern can be one or more of: an integer, a Range, a string, an Array of the possible single types.
    # Input is matched against patterns, and the first exact match has it's payload executed.
    # Matched input is passed in to the associated block, or to the controller through #options.
    #
    # Allowed payloads are the name of a controller class, in which case it is executed through its #run method, or a block, which is executed in the context of the current controller.
    #
    # #invalid has its associated block executed when the input does not possibly match any pattern.
    # #timeout's block is run when timeout expires before receiving any input
    # #failure runs its block when the maximum number of tries is reached without an input match.
    #
    # Execution of the current context resumes after #menu finishes. If you wish to jump to an entirely different controller, use #pass.
    # Menu will return :failed if failure was reached, or :done if a match was executed.
    #
    # @param [Object] args A list of outputs to play, as accepted by #play
    # @param [Hash] options Options to use for the menu
    # @option options [Integer] :tries Number of tries allowed before failure
    # @option options [Integer] :timeout Timeout in seconds before the first and between each input digit
    # @option options [Boolean] :interruptible If the prompt should be interruptible or not. Defaults to true
    # @option options [Hash] :input_options A hash of options passed directly to the Punchblock Input constructor
    # @option options [Hash] :output_options A hash of options passed directly to the Punchblock Output constructor

    # @return [Result] a result object from which the details of the utterance may be established
